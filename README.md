[toki pona](http://tokipona.org/) is a language with 120 words. So I thought...how could you encode that?

This is a simple tool that converts to and from toki pona to hex.

I'm lazy and nobody cares about this module, but if you really want, you can take a look at `test` for usage. The file in `dist` should work with CommonJS, AMD, and global export.
